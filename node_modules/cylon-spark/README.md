# Cylon.js For Spark

Cylon.js (http://cylonjs.com) is a JavaScript framework for robotics and physical computing using Node.js

This module provides an adaptor for the Spark core device using either the built-in Tinker protocol (https://www.spark.io/), or else [VoodooSpark](https://github.com/voodootikigod/voodoospark) from [@voodootikigod](https://github.com/voodootikigod). The VoodooSpark implementation uses the [Spark-IO](https://github.com/rwaldron/spark-io) node module from [@rwaldron](https://github.com/rwaldron/). Thank you!

## Getting Started

Install the module with: `npm install cylon-spark`

You'll need your `access_token` and `device_id` to push new software to your
Spark, and you can get both of these from Spark's [Build
tool](https://spark.io/build).

- **access_token:** In the Build tool, click on the Settings cog in the
  bottom-left corner to find your access token.
- **device_id:** After you have your Spark Core registered to your account
  through the Tinker app, click on the Cores section (just above the Settings
  cog) on the Build tool. Then, click on the arrow next to your core's name to
  get its device ID.

## Installing Firmware On Your Spark Core

You will need to install the appropriate firmware on your Spark Core to use it from Cylon.js. 

One option is to use the Tinker software, which has the same API as the "default.cpp" code that is included with the Gort CLI (http://gort.io). This routes all of your calls thru the Spark cloud, with is appropriate for communicating with Spark devices in a remote location.

Another option is to use the VoodooSpark firmware, which has its own binary API. This discovers your device thru the Spark cloud, and then routes all of your calls directly to the Spark Core device. This is appropriate for communicating with Spark devices on the same local subnet as the computer that you wish to control them from.

## Examples

### Spark using Tinker API:
```javascript
var Cylon = require('cylon');

// Initialize the robot
Cylon.robot({
  connection: { name: 'spark', adaptor: 'spark', accessToken: 'XYZPDQ123', deviceId: '123ABC456' },
  device: {name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 'D0'},

  work: function(my) {
    every((1).second(), function() {my.led.toggle()});
  }
}).start();
```
### Spark using VoodooSpark API:
```javascript
var Cylon = require('cylon');

// Initialize the robot
Cylon.robot({
  connection: { name: 'voodoospark', adaptor: 'voodoospark', accessToken: 'XYZPDQ123', deviceId: '123ABC456', module: 'spark' },
  device: {name: 'led', driver: 'led', pin: 'D0'},

  work: function(my) {
    every((1).second(), function() {my.led.toggle()});
  }
}).start();
```

* Submit a Github Pull Request to the appropriate branch and ideally discuss the changes with us in IRC.
* We will look at the patch, test it out, and give you feedback.
* Avoid doing minor whitespace changes, renamings, etc. along with merged content. These will be done by the maintainers from time to time but they can complicate merges and should be done seperately.
* Take care to maintain the existing coding style.
* Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality & Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
* All pull requests should be "fast forward"
  * If there are commits after yours use “git rebase -i <new_head_branch>”
  * If you have local changes you may need to use “git stash”
